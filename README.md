Emulation of 'deep dive' into documents.

## Installation

1. Download the repository and run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
pip install openai PyMuPDF pydub python-docx
```
This will install the required dependencies.

2. Add file named `key.txt` in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key in it.

## Usage

1. Add your document in the `sources` directory. The document can be in any of the following formats: .pdf, .docx, .txt.

2. Adjust the prompt in the `prompt.txt` file to fit your needs.

3. Run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
python scripts.py
```

This will generate a script in the `middle_phase.txt` file.

Check the file carefully and make any necessary changes.

The proper format is like this:

```
**MIKE**: Guys, have you heard about how AI models now require a small fortune just to use them? I mean, $2000 a month for access? I find that kinda mind-blowing! 

**JOHN**: Well, Mike, maybe AI has decided to become a luxury product, like cashmere socks or diamond-encrusted toothbrushes, heh! But hey, if it can solve math problems Iâ€™ve never even heard of, maybe it's worth it?

**KATE**: Hmm, interesting perspective, John. But let's be realistic - it's not like these AI are AGI, we're still way off from that. They're specialized tools, and specialization can be costly. The value might be in solving niche problems effectively.
```

> NOTE: The script is generated by a Large Langanuage Model and may contain errors. Check, whether the text is in the same line as the speaker's name. If not, correct it manually. Moreover, the speakers' names must be in uppercase and between **.

4. Run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
python make_audio.py
```

This will generate individual audio files for each of the lines from the script. in the `output_audio` directory. Moreover, it will generate a single audio file named `final_podcast.mp3` which will contain all the lines in a single file.

**Enjoy your podcast!**
